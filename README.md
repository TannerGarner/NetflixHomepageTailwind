# NetflixHomepageTailwind

Breakpoints: 1000px, 800px

This project is meant to replicate a Netflix homepage. It is styled using locally stored Tailwind and SCSS. To view properly, you must download the package.json file to access the appropriate Tailwind styles. It will not load correctly on Github Pages as I have not used the CDN link for Tailwind. 

The 800px breakpoint features some drastic mobile changes. It reduces much of what is on the screen and I did not have time to add the hamburger menu to create dropdown functionality to restore it. The majority of the content is still present however. 

The second of the side-scrolling menus (Continue Watching) functions differently from the first and I have failed to understand why.
